- `btc_timestamp_header0.dat`: a BTC header whose corresponding block contains the first transaction of a Babylon checkpoint
- `btc_timestamp_header1.dat`: a BTC header whose corresponding block contains the second transaction of a Babylon checkpoint
- `btc_timestamp.dat`: a full BTC timestamp of a consumer chain header
